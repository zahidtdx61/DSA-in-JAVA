## Introduction

This repository contains implementations of various data structures and algorithms in Java. The goal is to provide a comprehensive resource for learning and practicing DSA concepts. Each implementation includes detailed explanations and example usage.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, you can clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/zahidtdx61/DSA-in-JAVA.git
```

Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd DSA-in-JAVA
```

## Data Structures

The following data structures are implemented in this repository:

- Arrays
- Linked Lists
- Stacks
- Queues
- Trees
  - Binary Tree
  - Binary Search Tree
  - AVL Tree
  - Red-Black Tree
- Heaps
- Hash Tables
- Graphs

Each data structure has its own folder with implementation and test files.

## Algorithms

The following algorithms are implemented in this repository:

### Sorting Algorithms

- Bubble Sort
- Selection Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Merge Sort
- Quick Sort
- Heap Sort

### Searching Algorithms

- Linear Search
- Binary Search

### Graph Algorithms

- Depth-First Search (DFS)
- Breadth-First Search (BFS)
- Dijkstra's Algorithm
- Bellman-Ford Algorithm
- Floyd-Warshall Algorithm

### Dynamic Programming

- Fibonacci Sequence
- Longest Common Subsequence
- Knapsack Problem

Each algorithm has its own folder with implementation and test files.
